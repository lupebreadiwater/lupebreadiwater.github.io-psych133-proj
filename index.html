                    Car accidents caused by lack of sleep can be more deadly than by drugs or alcohol. Don’t get wrong, both are extremely dangerous, but the difference comes with reaction time. When you're driving intoxicated or high, you respond slower, but when you’re sleepy you have NO response in an accident
